# PLCSiemensSymulatorHMI

## Overview
Application serves as customizable (at certain level) desktop **HMI** panel and enables simultaneous communication between PC and **Siemens** PLCâ€™s. 
Most of already existing dektop HMI applications for Siemens PLC's (like e.g. WinCC) are commercial and paid, therefore the main purposes 
during development process of my application was to take advantage of free tools and libraries. Application with its look and functionalities resembles 
HMI operation panels, which are widely known in industrial environment as devices that allow to monitor and control PLC controllers or executive devices.

## Application description
Communication between application and PLC is realized by Sharp7 library based on Siemens Ethernet S7Protocol. Files and classes architecture is 
based on MVVM architectural pattern which main advantage is providing separation between business logic, back-end logic and frond-end layers. User is
able to create his own HMI panel, enabling control and interaction with PLC program. Application can store many HMI panel's configurations connected to 
different devices in the same time (different connection details for each PLC). Once created, the configuration is stored in .xml file and loaded every
time during program start. The user has a possiblity to take advantage of generated excel file (PLC SIM) which contains PLC's database variables and use 
it for simplyfied controls creation.
